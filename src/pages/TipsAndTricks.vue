                        <li>Pause after switching language! IF you are filling as a couple/family, you can do so, but make sure you click the toggle on the very first screen after clicking "Nuevo eTicket"</li>

                        <li>When completed, download the pdf of your eTickets first, then send to email too.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Airport Transportation: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will probably need AT LEAST an hour to go through customs. Please book your ride for roughly 1 hour (no checked bags) or 1.5 hours (checked bags) after your flight lands.</li>
                        <li>Whichever transportation service you choose, make sure to keep the airport name board service selected.</li>
                        <li>Stepping out of the terminal into the taxi area is kind of small and can be crazy. Keep in mind the name of your transportation service and look for your name board. There will be plenty of taxi drivers waving you down. You won't need them, just keep your eyes out for your name board</li>
                        <li>Transportation Services:
                            <ul>
                                <li>AmstarDMC: This is the resorts recommended transportation service.</li>
                                <li>Jayride: a hosting platform for taxis and shuttles that finds the most suitable ride based on time and place.</li>
                                <li>DAT: Great company/service, be prompt for this service as they only have a 10 min grace period to wait.</li>

            <h3>Departure Airport (Montana)</h3>
            <p>We recommend flying out of Bozeman, MT (BZN). Typically, flights are cheapest 6-8 weeks before departure, but we recommend tracking flight costs. We have found tickets for around $475 (round-trip, non-direct).</p>
            <p>We are also tracking costs. If you would like to receive email alerts from us, please email Karla at k.m.nettle@gmail.com</p>

            <h3>Venue</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not drink the water! Even to brush your teeth. You can get bottled water everywhere, and the restaurants provide filtered water. </li>
                <li>The DR is a developing country. Please keep this in mind when you are off the resort.</li>
                <li>The beach is public. This means that you will be approached by locals trying to sell services or goods. If you leave the resort, you should be prepared to be approached and be cautious.</li>
                <li>The food:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are many food options.</li>
                        <li>Try to eat around normal times, otherwise the food may be out or old</li>
                        <li>Be conscious of the fact that you are eating different food. It may take a day or two to adjust.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Book your spa treatments as soon as you book your room. They fill up fast!</li>
                <li>There are a few other activities you can book with the venue for additional cost. Check out the website for more. We did a private dinner on the beach that was phenomenal!</li>

                        <li>The resort has a partnership with AmstarDMC that has a lot of excursions that can be booked. You can either book ahead of time, or they have a full service concierge in the lobby upon arrival.</li>
