        <h3>Entry and Exit</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Airport: Punta Cana International Airport, Dominican Republic (PUJ)</li>
                <li>Resort: Dreams Royal Beach, Punta Cana</li>
                <li>Dominican Travel Authorization Form: They used to give out paper copies to fill out on the plane. They do not do that anymore. Link below to fill out the form. Print, email, and/or screenshot the QR code(s) to yourself for you (and family).</li>
                <li>Airport Transportation: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will probably need AT LEAST an hour to go through customs. Please book your ride for roughly 1 hour (no checked bags) or 1.5 hours (checked bags) after your flight lands.</li>
                        <li>Whichever transportation service you choose, make sure to keep the airport name board service selected.</li>
                        <li>Stepping out of the terminal into the taxi area is kind of small and can be crazy. Keep in mind the name of your transportation service and look for your name board. There will be plenty of taxi drivers waving you down. You won't need them, just keep your eyes out for your name board</li>
                        <li>Transportation Services:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Jayride: a hosting platform for taxis and shuttles that finds the most suitable ride based on time and place.</li>
                                <li>DAT: Great company/service, be prompt for this service as they only have a 10 min grace period to wait.</li>

            <h3>Departure Airport (Montana)</h3>
            <p>We recommend flying out of Bozeman, MT (BZN). Typically, flights are cheapest 6-8 weeks before departure, but we recommend tracking flight costs. We have found tickets for around $475.</p>
            <p>We are also tracking costs. If you would like to receive email alerts from us, please email Karla at k.m.nettle@gmail.com</p>

            <h3>Departure Airport (Wisconsin/Illinois/Minnesota)</h3>
            <p>We recommend flying out of Chicago.  We have found round-trip, direct flights for as low $275. When we visited last minute in April, we paid around $350 each (round-trip, direct).</p>

            <h3>Airline Notes:</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li> When checking into your flight (we chose American Airlines), you may need to: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download American Airlines app</li>
                        <li>Download Verifly, (a precheck of a sort). Verifly will hook into American Airline's app to allow for your 24 hour check-in. Here you will need to take a selfie per person along with scanning each person's passport. </li>
                        <li>Verifly may also ask you for if you have a Travel Authorization form. This is a generic term they use. The only form you need is the </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As of April 2022, the Dominican Republic has not required COVID vaccination proof, but states they can/may perform temperature checks. It may help to take pictures of your vaccination card should any questions come up.

            <h3>Venue</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not drink the water! Even to brush your teeth. You can get bottled water everywhere, and the restaurants provide filtered water. </li>
                <li>The DR is a developing country. Please keep this in mind when you are off the resort.</li>
                <li>The beach is public. This means that you will be approached by locals trying to sell services or goods. If you leave the resort, you should be prepared to be approached and be cautious.</li>
                <li>The Food:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are many food options.</li>
                        <li>Try to eat around normal times, otherwise the food may be out or old</li>
                        <li>Be conscious of the fact that you are eating different food. It may take a day or two to adjust </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Book your spa treatments as soon as you book your room. They fill up fast!</li>
                <li>There are a few other activities you can book with the venue for additional cost. Check out the website for more. We did a private dinner on the beach that was phenomenal!</li>

                        <li>You can also look at Viator, as that has been a highly recommended service as well.</li>
